# Planner

### 📅 A Smart and Intuitive Task Planning App

**Planner** is a modern, user-friendly task management application built with React (or whichever tech stack you’re using). It helps users organize, prioritize, and track their tasks efficiently, making planning simple and effective.

---

## 🚀 Why This Project Exists

- In real life, managing tasks can become chaotic — deadlines pile up, priorities shift, and things get lost.
- **Planner** solves this by combining a clean UI with powerful task-tracking capabilities.
- It’s built both as a personal productivity tool **and** as a showcase of my front-end development skills.

---

## ✅ Key Features

- **Task Creation & Management**: Create, update, and delete tasks with ease.  
- **Task Categorization**: Organize tasks by categories or labels (e.g., Work, Personal, Urgent).  
- **Due Dates & Reminders**: Assign due dates, so you never forget a deadline.  
- **Responsive Design**: Works smoothly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.  
- **Context & State Management**: Uses React Context (or your choice) to maintain global state.  
- **Utility Functions**: Helper utilities for sorting, filtering, and time calculations.
